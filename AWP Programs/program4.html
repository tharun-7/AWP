<h3 style="color:pink">Career Development Cell</h3>
<hr>
<p style="color:green;">Students are encouraged to seek opportunities and enhance their learning 
experience with practical knowledge. The Career Development Cell provides a platform for the 
students and the companies as well so that the collaboration is mutually beneficial.
Once a student enters this University, the Institution takes the entire responsibility to develop 
that individual into a personality. The students are overwhelmed with the opportunities they are 
provided with. They are left open to umpteen number of choices lying in front of them to choose in 
parallel to their academics. Centurion believes in enhancing its students through dedicated 
concentration on each and every student and sees to that everyone enhances their talents with the 
opportunities they are provided with. Once the placement season commences, one can feel the 
vibrant environment on the campus. Talents go barely unrecognized at Centurion as we leave no 
stone unturned to place our students.
Career Development Cell carries the twin responsibility of conducting Career Counseling and 
Training Programmes, and organizing the campus recruitment activities of the School. All students 
are encouraged to attend the training programs for an enhanced performance in the campus 
interviews. We hand hold our students through career guidance; through motivational activities and 
counseling, through knowledge sharing activities and through various capacity building measures. 
The trainees are closely monitored for improvements and gauged through several VST’s and 
company Mock tests, until they are ready and have gained eligibility.
Programs like JAVA Certification in association with IBM , Network Certification in 
association with CISCO, DB2 training Certification.
association with IBM and Campus Connect in association with Infosys are some of the achievements 
of the center.
